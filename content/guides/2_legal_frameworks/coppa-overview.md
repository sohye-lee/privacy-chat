# COPPA Overview

The **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** is a U.S. federal law enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that protects the online privacy of children under 13. The law applies to websites, online services, and mobile apps that collect personal information from children or knowingly allow such collection.

> **Latest Update:** Major amendments to the COPPA Rule were finalized in 2025, expanding definitions, strengthening parental consent requirements, and introducing new obligations for data retention, security, and AI technologies.[1][4][8][9][10]

---

## Who Must Comply with COPPA?

COPPA applies to:

- **Websites, online services, or mobile apps directed at children under 13** that collect, use, or disclose personal information.
- **General audience platforms** with actual knowledge they are collecting personal information from users under 13.
- **Services collecting personal information on behalf of child-directed sites**.
- **Mixed-audience services** (sites appealing to both children and adults) must use age screening and comply with COPPA for users under 13.[1][6][10]

> Even if your site is not intended for children, you may be subject to COPPA if you knowingly collect data from users under 13.

- Full name
- Home or physical address
- Online contact information (email, phone number, etc.)
- Screen name or user ID
- Social Security number or government-issued ID
- Geolocation data
- Photos, videos, or audio containing a child’s image or voice

## Parental Notice & Consent Requirements

Operators must:

- Provide a **clear, comprehensive privacy policy** describing data practices for children’s data.
- Give **direct notice to parents** before collecting information, including what data is collected, how it’s used, categories of third parties, and data retention practices.[1][3][10]
- Obtain **separate parental consent** for sharing information with non-integral third parties (e.g., for marketing or AI training purposes).[1][7][10]
- Offer parents the right to **review, delete, or refuse further collection or use** of their child’s information.
- Use **FTC-approved methods** for verifying parental consent, such as:  
  - Credit card or payment verification  
  - Signed consent forms  
  - Video calls or government ID checks  
  - Knowledge-based authentication  
  - Confirmation via phone or mail[10][11]

## Privacy Policy Requirements

A COPPA-compliant privacy policy must include:

- Names, addresses, and contact information for all site/service operators[2]
- What information is collected from children and how it is collected
- How the information is used
- Whether the information is disclosed to third parties (and their categories/identities)
- Data retention and deletion practices
- Parental rights and how to exercise them (review, delete, refuse further collection)
- Explanation of parental consent process
- How parents can contact the operator

The policy must be **prominently posted** on the homepage and at every point where children’s data is collected.[2][3][10]

---

## Data Minimization, Retention, and Security

- **Collect only what is reasonably necessary** for the activity or service.[3]
- **Data retention:** Retain children’s data only as long as needed for the stated purpose; delete securely when no longer necessary.[1][5][10]
- **Security:** Maintain a written information security program with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of children’s data.[1][5][10]
- **No secondary use:** Do not use children’s data for unrelated purposes (e.g., targeted advertising, AI training) without separate parental consent.[7][8][10]

---

## Special Rules for Mixed-Audience and AI Services

- **Mixed-audience sites** must use age screening and treat users under 13 according to COPPA requirements.[1][6][10]
- **AI technologies:** Disclosing children’s data for AI training or development requires separate, explicit parental consent.[7][8]

---

## Key Points for Web Agencies

If you build or manage child-directed sites or apps:

- Advise clients to consult legal counsel about COPPA.
- Do not enable analytics, ad networks, or third-party services that collect data from children without proper controls.
- Document how your service handles parental consent, data collection, and storage.
- Clarify your role and responsibilities in compliance.
