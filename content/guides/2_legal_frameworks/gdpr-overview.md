# GDPR Overview

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is the European Union’s comprehensive data privacy law, effective since **May 25, 2018**. It sets a global standard for data protection, applying not only to EU-based companies but also to any organization worldwide that handles the personal data of EU or EEA residents[2][7][10].

---

## What Is GDPR?

GDPR governs how organizations collect, use, store, and protect personal data of individuals in the **European Union (EU)** and **European Economic Area (EEA)**.  
The regulation emphasizes **user rights**, **consent**, **transparency**, and **accountability**[3][6][7][8].

---

## When Does It Apply to U.S. Companies?

GDPR applies to U.S. (and other non-EU) companies if they:

- **Offer goods or services** to individuals in the EU/EEA (whether paid or free)
- **Monitor the behavior** of individuals in the EU/EEA (e.g., via cookies, analytics, profiling)
- **Process EU/EEA user data** on behalf of an EU-based client

**Examples:**
- A SaaS product with EU users
- An e-commerce site shipping to EU countries
- A U.S. web agency maintaining websites for EU companies

> U.S.-based agencies must be careful when using tools like **Google Analytics**, session recording tools, or marketing trackers targeting EU users[9].

## User Rights Under GDPR

GDPR grants individuals extensive control over their personal data[3][6][7][8]:

- **Right of Access:** Request a copy of their personal data
- **Right to Rectification:** Correct inaccurate or incomplete data
- **Right to Erasure (“Right to be Forgotten”):** Request deletion of data
- **Right to Restriction:** Limit processing of their data
- **Right to Data Portability:** Receive and transfer data to another controller
- **Right to Object:** Object to processing based on legitimate interest or direct marketing
- **Rights in Automated Decision-Making:** Opt out of decisions made solely by automated processing, including profiling

> As of 2025, timelines for responding to some user rights requests have been shortened, and new rights around AI and data portability have been strengthened[5].

## Key Principles and Obligations for Businesses

Organizations must adhere to these core GDPR principles[4][6][7][8][10]:
