# Overview of Major U.S. Privacy Laws

While there is no single federal law like the GDPR, state-level frameworks such as **CCPA (California)**, **CDPA (Virginia)**, **CPA (Colorado)**, **UCPA (Utah)**, and **TDPSA (Texas)** are shaping best practices.

## Tip for Web Agencies

- **Texas**: Even if your agency or client is not based in Texas, **targeting Texas residents** through ads or analytics tools may trigger obligations.
- **Colorado**: Be cautious of **profiling technologies** like GA4, Meta Pixel, or third-party personalization tools—may require explicit opt-out UI.
- **Utah**: Although the law is more relaxed, it's good practice to **maintain uniform user experiences** and include opt-out and privacy links across all state audiences.
- **General**: Use the **strictest state requirement as your baseline** to simplify development and avoid regional discrepancies.
- **Client Discovery Checklist**:
  - What states are your client's users from?
  - Do they use targeted advertising or behavioral analytics?
  - Does their revenue exceed relevant thresholds?
  - Who maintains their privacy policy?
