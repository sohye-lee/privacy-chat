## 🏢 B2B (Business to Business)

### Common Traits
- Typically less direct personal data collection than B2C, but may still collect leads, emails, and business contact info.
- Focused on lead generation (contact forms, whitepapers, demos).

### Privacy Considerations
- **Do not assume fewer obligations:** Laws like CCPA, GDPR, and others can still apply if tracking, analytics, or cross-border data transfers are involved—even for B2B sites[1][7][18].
- **Third-party requirements:** Tools like Google Analytics, LinkedIn Ads, or CRMs may require a published privacy policy and consent mechanisms[1][13][15].
- **Data minimization:** Limit collection to what is necessary for business purposes.

**Typical Tools:** HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads, Calendly, Salesforce

**Recommended:**
- Clarify how lead data will be used/shared; avoid using data for purposes not disclosed to users.
- Include opt-in checkbox for contact or email forms, and document consent.
- Regularly audit contact lists and CRM integrations for compliance[15][18].

## 🛍️ B2C (Business to Consumer)

### Common Traits
- Direct customer data collection (emails, shipping address, purchase info).
- Targeted advertising, email marketing, and personalization.

### Privacy Considerations
- **CCPA, CDPA, CPA, UCPA, GDPR** may all apply depending on user locations[1][2][3][16].
- **Cookie banners and consent tools** are often required for tracking technologies[8][16].
- Privacy policy must include opt-out instructions and contact rights.
- **Consent for marketing:** Email and SMS marketing require opt-in consent in many jurisdictions.

**Typical Tools:** Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Klaviyo, Shopify, Mailchimp

**Recommended:**
- Confirm data sharing with ad platforms and add related disclosures.
- Ensure privacy policy includes sections on sales/sharing, customer rights, and data retention.
- Use a privacy-first approach to cookie management and avoid dark patterns in consent[8][16].

## ❤️ Nonprofits

### Common Traits
- Donation forms, volunteer sign-ups, event registrations.
- May use third-party fundraising, donor management, or email tools.

### Privacy Considerations
- Subject to similar laws as B2C if collecting donor or volunteer data from regulated regions[9].
- If serving children or collecting sensitive info, laws like COPPA or HIPAA may apply[9].
- Donor privacy and transparency are especially important for trust.

**Recommended:**
- Include clear data use statements for donations and volunteer info.
- Disclose all third-party tools (e.g., donor CRMs, payment processors).
- If collecting health or child data, consult a privacy professional and implement stricter safeguards[9].

## 🎓 Educational Institutions

### Common Traits
- Serve students, parents, teachers; collect student names, emails, age, grades.
- Increasing use of online learning platforms and analytics.

### Privacy Considerations
- **COPPA** applies if serving users under 13[4].
- **FERPA** applies to federally funded U.S. schools, protecting student education records[6][10].
- Email tracking, YouTube embeds, and analytics must be reviewed for compliance.
- Privacy policies should be clear, accessible, and regularly updated[10].

**Recommended:**
- Ask if students will access the site; if yes, review all data collection and tracking.
- Do not embed trackers on student-facing pages without proper disclosures and parental consent where required.
- Provide a clear privacy policy outlining data collection, use, and student rights.

## 🏥 Healthcare-Related Clients

### Common Traits
- Appointment forms, patient info, health-related content.
- May use scheduling, contact, or telehealth software.

### Privacy Considerations
- **HIPAA** may apply if the site is used by or for covered entities or collects Protected Health Information (PHI)[5][11].
- Do not store or transmit PHI unless explicitly authorized and secured.
- Tracking technologies (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) must not be used on PHI-collecting pages without a HIPAA risk assessment[11].

**Recommended:**
- Use HIPAA-compliant form solutions (e.g., Formstack, Paubox).
- Do not rely on Google Forms or standard CRMs unless they are HIPAA-compliant.
- Sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) if handling PHI for clients.
- Explicitly disclose all data flows and third-party integrations in the privacy policy.

## Agency Best Practices

- **Clarify responsibility:** The client is legally responsible for privacy compliance, but agencies should inform and guide them[13][19].
- **Document compliance:** Add a "Privacy Compliance Profile" to your project discovery or intake form, based on client type and data flows[1][12].
- **Stay current:** Privacy laws and third-party requirements change frequently; review policies and tools at least annually[1][13].
- **Contractual protection:** Use waivers or contracts to clarify your agency’s role and limit liability for compliance lapses[13][19].
