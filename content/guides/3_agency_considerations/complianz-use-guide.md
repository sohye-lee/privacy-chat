# üìÑ Complianz Usage Guide for Web Agencies

**Complianz** is a leading WordPress plugin for privacy and cookie compliance, supporting laws such as **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **ePrivacy**, and more. When used correctly by web agencies, Complianz can help clients achieve compliance while maintaining a smooth user experience[1][2][5][6].

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use Complianz

Complianz is especially effective when:

- The website receives **EU, UK, or California visitors**
- The site uses **Google Analytics**, **Meta Pixel**, **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, **Hotjar**, or other tracking/embedded services
- Clients require **automated cookie scanning**, **consent logging**, and **regular compliance updates**
- **Multilingual support** is needed (WPML, Polylang)
- The client prefers a **wizard-based setup** with minimal custom coding

## üîß Key Setup Sections & Agency Watchpoints

### 1. **Setup Wizard & Cookie Scan**
- The wizard guides you through site details, regions, services, and consent requirements[5].
- **Cookie scanner** detects first-party and most common third-party cookies/scripts[2][5][6].  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è *Always manually review and supplement the scan results*, as some custom or less common scripts may be missed[2][5].
  - Re-scan after adding new plugins, embeds, or scripts.

### 2. **Cookie Banner Configuration**
- Choose *opt-in* (GDPR/ePrivacy) or *opt-out* (CCPA) consent models per region[1][6].
- Customize banner design, text, and categories to fit the client‚Äôs brand[2][5].
- Use **Geo IP** detection to serve the right banner based on visitor location[2][6].
- Enable **Consent Statistics** for analytics on consent rates[3][6].
- Consider A/B testing (premium) to optimize consent UX[6].

### 3. **Integrations & Script Blocking**
| Service             | Auto Blocking | Manual Check Needed? | Notes                                                |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Analytics 4  | ‚úÖ           | Tag Manager setups   | Use gtag or GTM; ensure correct blocking before consent[3] |
| Meta Pixel          | ‚úÖ           | Custom scripts       | Confirm opt-in for EU users; check custom code[3]    |
| YouTube / Vimeo     | ‚úÖ           | ‚Äî                    | Placeholder until consent; blocks iFrames[6]         |
| Hotjar / HubSpot    | ‚úÖ           | ‚Äî                    | Session recording may need separate consent[6]       |
| Custom HTML Blocks  | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                   | Manually review scripts in Elementor, WPBakery, etc. |

- **Content Blocker**: Blocks embedded services (e.g., YouTube, Google Maps) until consent is given[2][5][6].
- **Script Center**: Fine-tune which scripts run based on consent categories[5].

### 4. **Privacy & Cookie Policy Generation**
- Complianz auto-generates Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and (for EU) Imprint pages[4][5][6].
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Manually review and supplement*:
  - Contact forms, custom email integrations, hosting/CDN providers, and any custom data flows[4][6].
- Policies are updated automatically with each scan, but agency review is essential for accuracy[6].

### 5. **Consent Logging & Data Requests**
- Consent logs are stored with timestamp, categories, and IP hash for audit/tracking[2][6].
- Ready-made **data request forms** can be enabled for user rights requests (access, deletion, etc.)[6].

## üß† Agency Tips

- **Group all marketing scripts** under the "Marketing" category for clarity in consent management.
- For **education/children‚Äôs sites**, enable stricter defaults (e.g., block YouTube, disable marketing cookies by default)[4].
- Validate that scripts in custom HTML blocks or page builders (Elementor, WPBakery) are detected and blocked as required[2][6].
- Regularly re-scan and review after any site updates or plugin changes[2][5].

## üåç Region-Based Banner Behavior

| Region      | Banner Behavior      | Legal Reference      |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| EU/UK       | Opt-in required     | GDPR, ePrivacy      |
| California  | Opt-out acceptable  | CCPA                |
| Canada      | Consent not always required | PIPEDA       |
| South Korea | Prior consent for sensitive data | PIPA    |

Use **Complianz's GEO detection** to serve appropriate banners and consent models automatically[6].

## üîç Common Pitfalls

- **Over-reliance on auto-scan:** Always manually review cookies/scripts, especially after adding custom code or plugins[2][5].
- **Incomplete policy content:** Auto-generated policies may miss custom integrations or data flows‚Äîsupplement as needed[4][6].
- **Not updating after changes:** Re-scan and review policies after every site/plugin update[2][5].
- **Neglecting consent logging:** Ensure logs are enabled and retained per legal requirements[6].
