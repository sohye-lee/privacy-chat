# Web Agency Privacy Compliance Checklist

A practical checklist to help web and digital agencies ensure that client websites meet current privacy requirements — without overpromising legal compliance.

---

## ✅ Before the Project Starts

- **Ask about audience geography**
  - Does the website target or receive traffic from California? Virginia? EU?
  - If yes, consider laws like CCPA, CDPA, or GDPR.

- **Clarify the nature of the business**
  - Health-related? → HIPAA might apply
  - Children's products? → COPPA likely applies

- **Check for third-party tools**
  - Analytics, heatmaps, CRMs, ad trackers
  - Make a list of all tools that collect personal data

- **Confirm hosting & data flow**
  - Where is the website hosted? Where is the data processed?
  - Especially important for GDPR (EU → U.S. data transfer)

---

## 🗣️ Understand Client Requirements

- Does the client already have a **privacy policy**?
  - If yes, review for outdated terms or missing components
  - If no, discuss whether they need help writing one

- Does the client **sell or share data** with third parties?
  - CCPA requires a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info" link

- Do they use cookies or trackers **before consent**?
  - Could trigger GDPR or CDPA compliance needs

## 📋 Recommended Policy Inclusions

These are standard sections a privacy policy should include:

- What personal data is collected (e.g., name, email, IP address)
- Why it’s collected (e.g., contact, analytics, orders)
- Who it’s shared with (third-party services, affiliates)
- How users can access or delete their data
- Contact information for privacy concerns
- Links to cookie policy or opt-out tools (if applicable)

## 💻 Development Phase – What to Watch

- **Forms**
  - Are you collecting names/emails? Add clear labels and usage intent
  - Include checkbox for newsletter opt-ins (don’t pre-check)

- **Cookies & Tracking**
  - Don’t load cookies (e.g., Google Analytics) before consent if GDPR applies
  - Consider cookie consent managers like Cookiebot, Termly, or self-hosted options

- **Accessibility**
  - Make sure consent tools and policies are screen-reader friendly

- **Embedded content**
  - YouTube, Google Maps, social embeds may track users — disclose these

## 🎓 Educating the Client

- Clients often assume "You added a privacy policy, we’re good"
  - **Clarify**: Compliance is ongoing and policy is one part of it

- Share a basic explanation of what the policy does
- If you manage updates, include reminders for annual reviews
- Encourage clients to subscribe to legal update resources:
  - [IAPP Newsletters](https://iapp.org/news/)
  - [Termly Policy Update Notifications](https://termly.io/)

> 💡 Tip: Make this checklist a part of your onboarding docs or discovery questionnaire. It shows professionalism and helps manage client expectations.
