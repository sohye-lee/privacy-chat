# Web Agency Privacy Compliance Checklist

A practical checklist to help web and digital agencies ensure that client websites meet current privacy requirements — without overpromising legal compliance.

---

## ✅ Before the Project Starts

- **Ask about audience geography**
  - Does the website target or receive traffic from California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Texas, or the EU/UK?
  - If yes, consider laws like CCPA/CPRA, CDPA, CPA, UCPA, TDPSA, or GDPR[1][2][3][7][8].

- **Clarify the nature of the business**
  - Health-related? → HIPAA might apply
  - Children's products or services? → COPPA likely applies
  - Education sector? → FERPA or COPPA may apply

- **Check for third-party tools**
  - Analytics (Google Analytics, Matomo, Plausible), heatmaps, CRMs, ad trackers, chat widgets
  - Make a list of all tools that collect or process personal data[1][2][3].

- **Confirm hosting & data flow**
  - Where is the website hosted? Where is the data processed and stored?
  - Especially important for GDPR (EU→US data transfer) and for state laws requiring data minimization and security[1][3][4].

- **Identify sensitive data**
  - Will the site process health, biometric, financial, or children's data?
  - If yes, additional legal requirements and stricter consent may be needed[2][3].

## 🗣️ Understand Client Requirements

- Does the client already have a **privacy policy**?
  - If yes, review for outdated terms, missing components, or non-compliance with new laws[2][3][7].
  - If no, discuss whether they need help drafting or updating one (use a vetted template or generator)[2][6][8].

- Does the client **sell or share data** with third parties?
  - CCPA/CPRA requires a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info" link and opt-out mechanisms[2][7].

- Do they use cookies or trackers **before consent**?
  - Could trigger GDPR, CDPA, or other compliance needs; consider a cookie consent manager[3][8].

- Are **universal opt-out mechanisms** (GPC, browser settings) supported?
  - Many state laws now require honoring these signals[6].

## 📋 Recommended Policy Inclusions

A privacy policy should always include[2][4][6][7][8]:

- **What personal data is collected** (e.g., name, email, IP address, device info)
- **Why it’s collected** (e.g., contact, analytics, orders, personalization)
- **How it’s collected** (forms, cookies, third-party tools)
- **Who it’s shared with** (third-party services, affiliates, processors)
- **How users can access, correct, or delete their data**
- **Data retention period** and deletion policy
- **Contact information** for privacy concerns or requests
- **Links to cookie policy or opt-out tools** (if applicable)
- **Children’s data clause** (if site may collect data from users under 13)[6]
- **Universal opt-out mechanism** (if required by state law)[6]

## 💻 Development Phase – What to Watch

- **Forms**
  - Are you collecting names, emails, or sensitive info? Add clear labels and specify usage intent.
  - Include an unchecked opt-in checkbox for newsletters or marketing.
  - Avoid collecting more data than necessary (data minimization)[3][8].

- **Cookies & Tracking**
  - Don’t load cookies (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) before consent if GDPR or similar laws apply[3][8].
  - Use a reputable cookie consent manager (Cookiebot, Termly, CookieYes, etc.)[3][8].
  - Categorize cookies and allow granular consent.

- **Accessibility**
  - Ensure consent tools and privacy policies are accessible to users with disabilities (screen-reader friendly)[1].

- **Embedded content**
  - YouTube, Google Maps, social embeds may track users — disclose these in your privacy policy and block until consent where required[3][8].

## 🎓 Educating the Client

- **Clarify**: Compliance is ongoing; a privacy policy alone is not enough[1][7].
- Share a basic explanation of what the privacy policy covers and why it matters.
- If you manage updates, include reminders for annual reviews or when adding new features/tools[7].
- Encourage clients to subscribe to legal update resources:
  - [IAPP Newsletters](https://iapp.org/news/)
  - [Termly Policy Update Notifications](https://termly.io/)

- **Document your process**: Keep a record of privacy discussions and recommendations for your own liability protection[1][7].

> 💡 **Tip:** Make this checklist part of your onboarding docs or discovery questionnaire. It demonstrates professionalism and helps manage client expectations from the start.
