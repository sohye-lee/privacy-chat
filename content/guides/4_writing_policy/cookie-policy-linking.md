# 📄 Cookie Policy Linking

Clearly communicating your use of cookies is not only a user-friendly practice but often a legal requirement depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, ePrivacy Directive).

## 🍪 Cookie Policy vs Privacy Policy

While the **Privacy Policy** covers how all personal data is collected and used, a **Cookie Policy** focuses specifically on:

- Types of cookies used (e.g., functional, analytics, advertising)
- Purposes of each cookie
- Third-party cookies (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
- How users can control or delete cookies

In Europe, it is recommended to **separate** the Cookie Policy from the main Privacy Policy to enhance clarity. In the U.S., a combined approach is often acceptable but not always ideal.

## 👁️ How to Present It to Users

- **Banner on first visit**: Notify users about cookie usage and obtain consent when required.
- **Consent options**: Provide choices such as "Accept All", "Reject All", or "Manage Preferences".
- **Consent logging**: Store consent records (important for GDPR compliance).
- **Easy access**: Allow users to update their preferences anytime.
