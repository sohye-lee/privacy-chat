# Archiving Previous Privacy Policies

Keeping a historical record of your clients' privacy policies isn’t just good housekeeping — it’s a legal and operational safeguard. Here’s why it matters and how to do it right.

## 🧾 Why Archive Privacy Policies?

- **Legal Defense**: In case of complaints or audits, being able to show the version of the policy in effect at a certain date is essential.
- **Transparency**: Demonstrates compliance and good faith to regulators and users.
- **Change Management**: Tracking what changed and when helps with future updates and consistency.
- **Contractual Obligations**: Some clients may be required by law or contract to retain previous policy versions (e.g., medical or financial sectors).

## 🗂️ How to Store Old Versions

### 🖨 Save as PDF
- At every major policy change, export the full privacy policy page to PDF.
- Use a consistent naming format like `privacy-policy_2024-07-01.pdf`.

### 🌐 Save as Static HTML
- Export the rendered HTML or create a flat backup of the page.
- Store in a secure internal folder or a private Git repository.

### 💾 Backup Location Ideas
- Encrypted folders in Google Drive, Dropbox, or internal company server
- Notion, Confluence, or Airtable databases
- Use version control (Git) for markdown-based policies

## 📋 How to Track Changes

- Use **version numbers** (e.g., v1.2 → v1.3) in the document footer.
- Maintain a **changelog** with:
  - Date of change
  - Summary of updates (e.g., "Added Google Analytics clause")
  - Who approved the change

**Tools to help**:
- [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) for text comparison  
- GitHub/GitLab for markdown-based policies  
- WordPress plugins (e.g., Simple History, WP Activity Log) to track content edits

## 🤝 Client Contracts and Handoff

- Clarify in your web development agreement:
  - Who owns the privacy policy content
  - Who is responsible for updates
  - Whether archiving is the agency’s responsibility

- Recommend clients appoint an internal **privacy contact person** for ongoing policy oversight.
- Offer **annual policy reviews** as a recurring service or maintenance add-on.
