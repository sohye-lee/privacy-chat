# When Should You Update Your Privacy Policy?

A privacy policy isn’t a “write once and forget” document. It must evolve alongside your website, services, and applicable laws.

## 🔧 When You Add New Features

If you introduce:
- **User accounts or login functionality**
- **Newsletter or email subscriptions**
- **Payment processing or ecommerce**
- **Third-party tools** like analytics, chat widgets, CRM integrations

Then you must disclose:
- What new data you collect
- How you store and use it
- Any third-party access involved

📌 *Example*: Adding Google Analytics requires disclosure and consent handling.

## ⚖️ When Laws Change

Changes in privacy regulations may require updates to stay compliant. Monitor:
- CCPA / CPRA (California)
- CDPA (Virginia)
- GDPR (EU) — if international users are served
- COPPA (for children-related content)
- New state laws (e.g., Texas, Colorado, Utah)

📌 *Example*: The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), effective in 2023, introduced new user rights and obligations.

## 👤 When User Expectations Change

As your business evolves:
- Do you serve new audiences (e.g. children, healthcare users)?
- Are you collecting more detailed personal data?
- Are you using data for profiling, marketing, or AI personalization?

Policies must match current user impact and expectations.

📌 *Example*: Switching from basic contact forms to full onboarding flows likely requires policy updates.

## 📆 Recommended Regular Check-Ups

Even without changes, review your policy at least:
- **Every 12 months**
- **After each major platform update**
- **During annual legal/compliance audits**

This ensures accuracy and reduces liability.
