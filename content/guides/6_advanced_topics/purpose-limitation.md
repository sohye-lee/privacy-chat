# Purpose Limitation Principle: Stick to the Purpose

The **purpose limitation** principle is a foundational privacy standard requiring organizations to collect and use personal data **only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes**.

## 🎯 What Is a “Purpose of Collection”?

When collecting personal data, you must define **why** it is needed.

For example:

- Email address → to send account updates
- Location data → to show nearby services
- Birthdate → to verify age or offer birthday deals

🛑 **Wrong practice**: Collecting extra data “just in case” it becomes useful later.

## 🔒 Why Data Must Be Used Only Within the Consent Scope

According to:

- **GDPR Article 5(1)(b)**:  
  > “Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.”  
  → [Source](https://gdpr.eu/article-5-how-does-it-affect-you/)

- **CCPA/CPRA**: Requires disclosing intended uses of data and allows users to **limit further use**.

Why this matters:

- Users must know **how** their data will be used.
- You risk **violating consent** if you repurpose data later.
- For agencies: always tie each form or data field to a clear purpose.

## ⚖️ Are There Exceptions?

Yes, but they're narrow:

| Case | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Legal obligation** | You may use data to comply with legal requests or tax regulations. |
| **Public interest or research** | Sometimes permitted under strict conditions. |
| **Internal security/fraud detection** | Allowed, but still must be disclosed. |

Always consult legal guidance for edge cases — especially if you serve **EU users** or minors.

## ✍️ How to Reflect This in a Privacy Policy

### Good Example:

> "We collect your email address solely to send you product updates and important notices. We do not use it for marketing without your explicit consent."

### Poor Example:

> "We may use your information for various business purposes."

**Tips:**

- Be specific about each data type and its use.
- Avoid vague catch-all phrases.
- Use **plain language** — your clients’ users are not lawyers.

🛠 If using third-party services (e.g. Google Analytics, Hotjar, Mailchimp), state **why** and **how** the data is shared.

---

## 🧠 Summary

> ✅ **Collect with a purpose. Use with integrity.**  
> Purpose limitation builds user trust and ensures compliance.
